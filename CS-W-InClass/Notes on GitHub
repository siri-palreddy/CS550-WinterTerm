I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item


First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column


@ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment.
This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.


Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.


Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.
